o This section is repeated and is found in the Main Directory READ ME.txt file (See Full Directory Structure)

o Due to the size of the executable file (final product) which was over 700 MB and modern compression methods were not enough, I moved the final product into this OneDrive for easy accessibility: https://cityuni-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/thomas_beard_city_ac_uk/EhDHJkZrZilFpqYddBSOY8QBLtj4K9pJ2hGdYCW6mWSEQw?e=i5lJjS

o The system only currently works with the exact dependencies installed listed in the Installation Instructions. (Please check Installation Instructions for further detail).

o It is vital that all requirements and dependencies are installed before running the product. (Please check Installation Instructions for further detail).

o The product has only been tested on a Windows OS and therefore should only be ran on the same OS. 

o The pre-trained model the semantic and hybrid paradigm in the main system uses, is from: https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2

o The TREC collection, relevance assessments and queries provided by: https://github.com/oussbenk/cranfield-trec-dataset/tree/main

o Using solr version 9.5.0 from: https://archive.apache.org/dist/solr/solr/
